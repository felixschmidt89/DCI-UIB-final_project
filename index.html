        <h1>Hi! I'm Felix - <strong>a Web Dev Student</strong> at DCI.</h1>
        <section>
          I've spent my professional life (7 years) in different roles centered
          around WEB software at dynamic, fast-growing and ever-changing tech
          startups. In my most recent role as POS expert Treatwell (4.5 years), it was my job as a crucial part of the product team to lay the ground
          for gaining and retaining legal compliance of a Point of Sale software
          module in 10 different western European markets.</section>

          <section>
            In essence, I researched the vast variety of legal requirements in a
            market, broke them down and owned meeting all non-technical ones while
            at the same time conveying technical requirements to the dev team and
            closely consulting them on delivery. Becoming the go-to-guy for all
            POS newly emerged topics and queries and occasionally stepping in as
            Product Manager, I acquired special knowledge about fiscalisation
            across Europe, slowly realizing that I highly enjoy the collaborated
            work and its constant challenges and I'd rather acquire generic web
            development skills to continue working in this field without being
            bound to a single - let's face it - rather uninspiring topic.<br>
            <br>Consequently, and since I'm a quick learner, have proven to be a
            problem solver, good at mathematics and logics, excel at hours of
            focused, autonomous & challenging work paying great attention to
            detail and can tell from experience, that software development is
            where I want to work, I had decided to aim for a career change: First
            go on a sabbatical year and then move from product to tech and acquire
            what I'm lacking - coding skills - to not only work with web
            developers but become one myself.

        <h2>Project</h2>
        <section>This website is my final project of the very first technical module as part of the Web Development Course at Digital Care Insitute (DCI): During this module (User Interface Basic) I’ve learned to design & build websites with HTML & CSS first and then expanded on the basics of Sass and bootstrap afterwards.
          Now, it's time to showcase what I've learned up to this point.</section>
          <section>After dabbling with Bootstrap and stumpling upon its limitations regarding some of my ideas and also given the scope and purpose of this project, I’ve decided against using Bootstrap and build everything from scratch without using any framework or template. 
          But since I'm looking forward to collaborating with others and value structured and DRY coding, I've made use of Saas. If you'd like to see my code, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/felixschmidt89/DCI-UIB-final_project" target="_blank">related GitHub repository</a>.
         If you want to learn more about what other skills I'm about to acquire during the course at DCI, please give <a href="https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/courses/web-development/" target="_blank">this</a> a read. Next up will be JavaScript & React.</section>
