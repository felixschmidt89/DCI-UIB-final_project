        <h1>Hi! I'm Felix - <strong>a Web Dev Student</strong> at DCI.</h1>
        <section id="about-me">
          I've spent my professional life (7 years) in different roles centered
          around WEB software at dynamic, fast-growing and ever-changing tech
          startups. In my most recent role as POS expert Treatwell (4.5 years), it was my job as a crucial part of the product team to lay the ground
          for gaining and retaining legal compliance of a Point of Sale software
          module in 10 different western European markets.</section>

            In essence, I researched the vast variety of legal requirements in a
            market, broke them down and owned meeting all non-technical ones while
            at the same time conveying technical requirements to the dev team and
            closely consulting them on delivery. Becoming the go-to-guy for all
            POS newly emerged topics and queries and occasionally stepping in as
            Product Manager, I acquired special knowledge about fiscalisation
            across Europe, slowly realizing that I highly enjoy the collaborated
            work and its constant challenges and I'd rather acquire generic web
            development skills to continue working in this field without being
            bound to a single - let's face it - rather uninspiring topic.

            Consequently, and since I’m a quick learner, have proven to be a
            problem solver, good at mathematics and logics, excel at hours of
            focused, autonomous & challenging work paying great attention to
            detail and can tell from experience, that software development is
            where I want to work, I had decided to aim for a career change: First
            go on a sabbatical year and then move from product to tech and acquire
            what I’m lacking - coding skills - to not only work with web
            developers but become one myself.
