# DCI-UIB-final_project

This website is my final project of the very first technical module as part of the Web Development Course at [Digital Career Institute](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/). 
During this module (**'User Interface Basic'**) I've learned how to design & build websites with **HTML** & **CSS** first and then expanded on the basics of Sass and Bootstrap.
Now, it's time to showcase what I've learned up to this point. Given the scope and purpose of this project and its limitations regarding some of my ideas, I've decided against using Bootstrap 
and instead build everything from scratch without using any framework or template.
But since I'm looking forward to collaborating with others and value structured and DRY coding, I've made use of Saas.
